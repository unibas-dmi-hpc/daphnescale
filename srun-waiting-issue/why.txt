The reason was, that old experiments were not running on VEGA if not specifying --cpus-per-task in the sbatch but only in s run. 

Did not work:
sbatch {input.sbatch} {wildcards.num_threads} {input.script} {input.mtx} {params.matrix_size} {output}
--> see slurm-14027369.out, only 2 CPUs are in the allowed list, not enough if requesting 4

Did work:
sbatch --cpus-per-task={wildcards.num_threads} {input.sbatch} {wildcards.num_threads} {input.script} {input.mtx} {params.matrix_size} {output}
--> see slurm-14027650.out, more then 4 cpus allowed so working.

The interesting part.: Why did the behaviour of VEGA change.
